This guide will only cover the Unity part. For full details, I recommended reading the [official documentation](https://docs.smartlydressedgames.com/en/stable/about/getting-started.html). 
This guide also will use the v1 .dat files and not v2 .asset files for simplicity and consistency with other guides.
