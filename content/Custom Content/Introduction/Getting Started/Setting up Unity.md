Modding Unturned requires using Unity. Most 2021.3 LTS version should be compatible; Unturned recommends using 2021.3.29f1 (as of 2025-08-18).
Once you install Unity, **create a project** to store your mods.
### Importing Tools
Unturned provides multiple Unity packages. These packages include examples that can be referenced when creating custom content, and provide the tools necessary to export content from Unity.
1. Open your Unity project.
2. Select **Assets > Import Package > Custom Packageâ€¦** from the toolbar.
3. In the file browser, navigate to the `.../Unturned/Extras/Sources` directory.
4. Import the `Project.unitypackage` and `ExampleAssets.unitypackage`. 
#### Project.unitypackage
This package contains the bare-bones required to export custom content:
* Default Project Settings
* [Asset Bundling Tools](https://docs.smartlydressedgames.com/en/stable/assets/asset-bundles.html#doc-asset-bundles)
* [Mod Hooks](https://docs.smartlydressedgames.com/en/stable/assets/mod-hooks.html#doc-assets-mod-hooks) (optional)
#### ExampleAssets.unitypackage
This package contains vanilla content examples, and several useful prefabs:
* `CoreMasterBundle` directory has an example of each type of vanilla asset.
* `Game/Sources/Animations` directory has examples of vanilla item animations.
* `Resources/Characters/Preview.prefab` is helpful for previewing clothes.

>[!important]
Mods should **not** be placed into the `CoreMasterBundle` directory. Instead, utilize the `Sandbox` folder for global testing or `.../SomeMap/Bundles` for local map testing.
