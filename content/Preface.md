<u></u># Why?

This documentation's purpose is to document the information I gather and organize. This is a personal documentation and is up to my personal standards so don't expect too much. Information on Unturned modding are really obscure and hard to kind, this exists to document and archive the knowledge I gather.
I will not be documenting most outdated/deprecated information unless it is widely used.

Also, this documentation is on github so you can go there and see changes and (maybe) do pull requests, though I'm unsure if I will respond. [GitHub](https://github.com/Wittummm/unturned-mod-docs.git)
